# Gene Protein Analysis

* Here provides codes to analyze gene and protein data


* To avoid code bugs, I recommend to seperate analyses with different python packages and scripts. Quantiprot can be used to extract sequence features for further ML analyses. Biopython can be used to generate phylogenic trees and test simple ML results.

* Have fun!!
